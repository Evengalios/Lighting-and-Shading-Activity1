# Lighting & Shading â€” Activity 1

## What I implemented
Using a base texture and a normal map, I Implemented a normal-mapped Surface Shader using Unity's Surface Shader system with the Lambert lighting model.

 Shader code

## Reflection
**Strengths**
- I was able to implement the normal mapping quickly. I alsoo noticed the immediate visual improvement compared to flat shading, the textures look a lot more "real".  
- I Learned how to use UnpackNormal() and how to control normal strength with _BumpScale.

**Weaknesses**
- I spent a lot of time fixing Shader compilation errors. Like programming anything, finding the issue takes a ton of searching and it was made even more difficult due to the fact that I am not confident in compiling shaders yet.
  
- I need to get better at handling tangent space versus object space normals when building custom meshes

**Opportunities / Next steps**
- I want to add specular (Blinn-Phong) or rim lighting to combine with normal mapping.
- I want to also try Shader Graph in URP for visual iteration.
